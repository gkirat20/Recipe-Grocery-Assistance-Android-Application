            <h1> Postmortem:</h1>
            <h2> What went right in the development process? :</h2>

            <p>As a group, we had the necessary skills to create what we wanted to.  Should one of us not possess a skill, <br>
                at least one other member would have the necessary knowledge.  This means that aside from any features we didn’t have time for, <br>
                we were able to implement everything we wanted to with not too many issues.

            </p>

            <h2> What went wrong in the development process? :</h2>

            <p>Despite the fact that we had the skills, we did not manage our time well.  There were many days <br>
                when we did not communicate with each other and because of this, we didn’t know if work was <br>
                being done.  Because of this, we tended to leave work to the last minute which was the problem <br>
                we wanted to solve in our iteration 2 retrospective.  Unfortunately, we didn’t follow up with our <br>
                plan and as such, we ran into time constraints and had to cut a few features out.<br>

            </p>


            <h1> Velocity:</h1>
            <p>We cannot get a velocity chart, but we can estimate what it would look like.
                <br>
                It would likely appear to have many spikes in velocity as the milestone deadlines approach,
                <br>
                this is because we didn’t manage our time very well and because of this,
                <br>
                We spent a lot of time doing work close to the deadline.
				<br>
				estimated to spent 3 days and 6 hours and we ended up spending 4 days and 2 hours.
				<br>
				This is different is high and it is evidence that we need to work on time management.
