## Grocery Recipe App Vision Statement

The Grocery Recipe App will be used to help users look for recipes and organize their grocery list. Furthermore, it will allow the user to plan their meals.

The application will record the user personal information and dietary preferences, and recommend recipes based on popularity as well as the user preferences and search history.

The app will allow users to search for recipes based on names, main ingredients and cuisine. Results of the search can be viewed and filtered with the user dietary preferences in mind. It will display detailed instructions of each recipe, both in text and in videos. It will also allow ratings and bookmark of a recipe for the user future reference. The list of ingredients from one ore more recipe(s) can be added to the user's personal grocery list.

The application will feature the ability to create new recipes. The ability for the user to add their own recipe will allow the application to be more useful to the user's day-to-day life.

The application is to be used by profesional chefs as well as home cooks. It will permit chefs to share their recipes and instructions, as well as to monitor the popularity of their recipes and answer other users' questions. Home cooks can search for new recipes and manage the ingredients in their grocery lists for shopping. They can also share their own recipes and give ratings and comments on recipes that they have tried.

The application will be a significant improvement over the traditional recipe websites, which only display recipes. The user will now have the ability to conveniently add the recipe's ingrediences and plan their meals. By having the ability to add ingredients into the grocery list, it provides a one-stop destination for users to look up new recipes and manage their grocery lists for a more streamlined process. On the other hand, the meals plan feature will alow the user to conveniently incorporate the application into their daily life. This application will offer the user great and easy to use experience to improve their life.

The application will be considered a success based on the user able to navigate easily and the user able to incorporate the application to their daily meal plan.

The application is initially to be developed as an Android application, but future versions can be created for iOS web-application.

For future implementation, we can have a feature to plan the meals. User can plan their meals in the calendar and import the ingrediences to the grocery list. It will be convinience for the user to have their grocery list organized.
